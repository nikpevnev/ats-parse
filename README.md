## Description

This Python script parses a block of text and identifies the top 25 most frequent nouns using spaCy, a natural language processing library. It then visualizes these nouns in a horizontal bar chart using Matplotlib, with the frequency axis displayed on the top of the graph.

This tool can be particularly useful for analyzing text data such as job descriptions, articles, or reports, helping users quickly identify the most important subjects or topics.

### The following information is processed and displayed:
- **Top 25 most frequent nouns**
- **Frequency of each noun** 
- **Horizontal bar chart with frequency axis on top**

### The script can either:
- Visualize the results in a Matplotlib plot
- Be adapted to save the results or graph if needed
